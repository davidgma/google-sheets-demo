<p>This is a simple demonstration of how to write Angular Typescript code to use the Google Sheets API. I wrote it because when I came to work out how to do this I found a lack of a good examples elsewhere.</p> 
<p>It's actually very simple to do - you don't need to use a secret key or an API key or pass authorisation tokens about in your code. Google's OAuth and API code handle all that for you seamlessly. This contrasts with Google's own documentation which, at the time of writing, only had examples that did pass an API key and an authorisation token in the code even though the same documentation says you shouldn't put an API key in browser code and even though it works without passing an authorisation token around in the code. I am unduly stupid though so perhaps I was missing something.</p>
<p>The underlying code for this demonstration is free open source software issued under the MIT license and can be found on Github at <a href="https://github.com/davidgma/google-sheets-demo">https://github.com/davidgma/google-sheets-demo</a>. That site also contains a readme file with information about some of the notable aspects of the code that I hope you will find helpful if you want to re-use the code in your own app.</p>
<p>I have also put the same code into a Stackblitz demo in case you like to tinker. This is at <a href="https://stackblitz.com/edit/google-sheets-demo">https://stackblitz.com/edit/google-sheets-demo</a></p>
<p>Note that you need to enable third-party cookies in your browser settings as Google's OAuth needs them.</p>
